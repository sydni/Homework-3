# README for Homework 3:
##Sticky Notes Website

We created a react app that allows the user to add, delete, and edit notes. It contains two components - an app component and a note component. The notes display the content in Markdown, and are draggable as well.

One thing that didn't work for me was using flex boxes, so I decided to only make the header and its two sections into a flex boxes, and not the rest of the text. This ended up working very nicely for me.

###Extra Credit

- Notes are resizable
- Website is pretty!
